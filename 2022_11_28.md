# Oxide and Friends: November 28th, 2022

## Leaving Twitter with Tim Bray

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording from November 28th, 2022](https://youtu.be/GZF96XmmJg8).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://mastodon.social/bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://mastodon.social/ahl),
our special guest was
[Tim Bray](https://mastodon.cloud/@timbray).
Other speakers on November 28th included
[Adam Jacob](https://hachyderm.io/@adamhjk),
[Toasterson](),
and [raggi]().

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [Bye, Twitter](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2022/11/26/Bye-Twitter) by Tim Bray
- [@M:SS](link into recording) *Leventhal's Conundrum*
- [jwz: PSA: Do Not Use Services That Hate The Internet](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2022/11/psa-do-not-use-services-that-hate-the-internet/)
- [jwz: Mastodon stampede](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2022/11/mastodon-stampede/)  _"Federation" now apparently means "DDoS yourself."_
- Tim Bray [On Algorithms](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2022/11/28/On-Algorithms)
- On terrible Twitter ads: [@intelnews: "Moore’s Law only stops when innovation stops.”](https://twitter.com/intelnews/status/1579366123421810689)
- PRs needed!
